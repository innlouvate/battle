# Makers Academy week 3: Battle

Setup
--------
This project was completed using TDD and pairing. The daily changing pair programming nature of Maker's means that the project code base can change on a daily basis. Therefore, there are seperate (often ophan) branches for each session and these have not been merged due to differences in approach. 

Task
------
Create a basis battle between two players / player and computer with an attack method which deducts points until one wins.
